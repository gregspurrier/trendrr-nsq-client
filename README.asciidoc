==================

This project bundles https://github.com/mreiferson/TrendrrNSQClient[TrendrrNSQClient] and its dependency
https://github.com/trendrr/java-oss-lib[trendrr-oss]. As far as I know, neither project publishes

1.2.0-SNAPSHOT and can be included as a Leiningen dependency with:

NOTE: TrendrrNSQClient is currently being pulled from my https://github.com/gregspurrier/TrendrrNSQClient[fork]
