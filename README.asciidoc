trendrr-nsq-client
==================

This project bundles https://github.com/mreiferson/TrendrrNSQClient[TrendrrNSQClient] and its dependency
https://github.com/trendrr/java-oss-lib[trendrr-oss]. As far as I know, neither project publishes
artifacts to a public repository. This project fills the gap for Clojure users by building their JARs and
deploying them to http://cloars.org[Clojars].

This project is versioned independently of TrenderNSQClient and trendrr-oss.

NOTE: TrendrrNSQClient is currently being pulled from my https://github.com/gregspurrier/TrendrrNSQClient[fork]
in order to pick up a fix for a deadlock on client close.
